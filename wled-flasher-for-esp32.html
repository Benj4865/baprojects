        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This porject started as a personal need to easily flash WLED firmware onto multiple ESP32 boards.
            By using a Raspberry Pi as a host, I developed a plug-and-play flasher that simplifies the process,
            making it accessible for users without the need to use the browser-based WLED flasher tool.

        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>
            The WLED Flasher for ESP32 is designed to streamline the firmware flashing process.
            By connecting ESP32 boards to a Raspberry Pi, users can automatically detect and flash
            WLED firmware without manual intervention. This tool is particularly useful for
            enthusiasts and developers who frequently work with ESP32-based LED projects.

        <h2>Current Status</h2>
        <p>
            Early concept and prototyping phase. Core mechanics are being tested
            in a virtual environment before moving to physical implementation.
